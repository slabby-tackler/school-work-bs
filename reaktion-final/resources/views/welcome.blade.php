		This is my final project for ENGL 2116, Technical Communications. The purpose of this project was to write several different documents based
		off a book from the publisher Reaktion.
	</p>
	<p>
		The book I chose for this project was "Fox" by Martin Wallen. All documents on this site are written by me and are fox related, whether it be hunting them or 
		looking in to the impact they may have had on an ecological system.
