		<strong>Detail</strong><br>
		On the 3rd of March 2017, an injury was brought to the attention of the main office. During a fox hunt Percival Luckinbill fell off his horse near the eastern tree line and broke his
		arm. According to his friend Nigel Tullet, something spooked the horse Mr. Luckinbill was riding. This caused the horse to rear sending Mr. Luckinbill flying backwards. Neither Mr.
		Luckinbill nor Mr. Tullet saw what frightened the horse.

		<strong>Result</strong><br>
		Mr. Luckinbill opted out of getting help from paramedics, and had Mr. Tullet drive him to the emergency room. Lodge workers have been sent out to find what may have scared the horse,
		but were unable to find anything.
