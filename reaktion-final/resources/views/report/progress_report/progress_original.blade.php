		<strong>Scope & Purpose</strong><br>
		Since Aristotle, the fox has been given a bad reputation. His philosophy was that since foxes lived in dens in the ground, they come from the ground, and therefore they are evil.
		After this the fox has been portrayed as a demon, a thief, and deceitful.
	</p>

	<p>
		The purpose of this was to change the opinions from that of the older civilizations. To do this several different means of persuasion are used. These methods involve specific
		marketing, appeals to emotion, and modifying perception.
	</p>

	<p>
		<strong>Progress</strong><br>
		Some decent progress has been made in changing people’s opinion of the fox. The first means of doing this was making the fox relatable. For this to work, the fox was featured in a
		new beer commercial. In the commercial, a fox goes to the pub after a long day of work and orders an Old Speckled Hen. In this instance, there is a metaphor for the fox catching a
		chicken dinner being similar to lusting for a nice brew after a long day.
	<p>

	<p>
		To help sway the opinion of others, the suggestion of having a fox as a pet was given. The few people that were given one seemed to enjoy the company and the playful nature of the
		fox. In the past when people have tried to domesticate foxes it did not work to their standards. The goal in this was to introduce the idea, not for it to absolutely work out. A
		follow up for the recipients will be necessary to see how they get along, after taking care of the fox for a while and to see if some sort of emotional attachment was acquired.
	</p>

	<p>
		<strong>Additional Work</strong><br>
		The next steps in improving people’s opinion of the fox is to remove the sexual connotations and convince others to stop wearing fox fur garments. Sex is considered immoral in some
		societies, and in many instances the fox is used as a sex symbol. To correct this the plan is to produce movies and plays that portray the fox in a different light. The new portrayal
		will be as a roguish hero. By this the fox will solve problems and stop villains in a cunning or charismatic way.
	</p>

	<p>
		Getting people to stop wanting fox fur garments is trickier matter to deal with. There is not much that can be done about the items that people already own beyond discouraging them
		from wearing it. The lack of seeing in everyday fashion should trickle into what people want to buy, which should lower the demand for new fox fur garments to be made. The other part
		of this will convince people not to purchase any new items. Doing this will be more difficult as a new item will possibly need to be made to take the interest away from the fox fur.
	</p>

	<p>
		<strong>Conclusion</strong><br>
		With some of the infrastructure is in place, time will show how effective the current work is. From current projections what has been done should show a lot of progress toward the
		final objective. Soon new projections will come in for the next steps, and there is the hope that it shows an equal or greater amount of progress for the final goal.
