		<strong>Executive Summary</strong><br>
		With the value of fox furs increasing, there needs to be a way to properly maintain the supply of foxes. The given solution to this is to move a number of foxes from their native
		lands to an enclosed area. Instead of caging or fencing off an arbitrarily large area, it would be best to move them to a private island.
	</p>

	<p>
		The best place to move these foxes is the island of Attu, in the Bering Sea. Placing them here, is a slightly more humane way to keep the foxes, as it is not too different from their
		natural habitat. The location of this island is also ideal because it allows for a natural cage. The island is south enough in the area that when winter hits, the area around the
		island will not freeze over. From the lack of freezing, the foxes located on this island will not be able to migrate beyond the beaches. After surveying the area, it was discovered
		that small prey was abundant on the island. This abundance will allow the foxes to flourish with little care from trappers.
	</p>

	<p>
		After a short time and the foxes begin to breed it will be possible to hunt and gather them with relative ease. If they are not over hunted, this should provide an infinite source of
		foxes for the fur trade.
