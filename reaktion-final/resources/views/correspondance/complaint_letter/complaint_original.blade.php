		Subject: Recent Shipment of Foxes (Order No. 2834256)
	</p>

	<p>
		On the 28th of February, I received a shipment of three foxes from you. I subsequently released them, so I could prepare for my hunt the following morning.
	</p>

	<p>
		Unfortunately, the foxes you sent acted in an unexpected way. When spotted by my hounds they gave poor chase, which led to an unexciting and disappointing hunt.
	</p>

	<p>
		Since these foxes performed poorly, I would like to receive replacements that will give better chase. As a hunting fox supplier I would have expected something better. If your
		quality of
		foxes does not improve I will have to find another company to supply me.
	</p>

	<p>
		Sincerely,
	</p>
