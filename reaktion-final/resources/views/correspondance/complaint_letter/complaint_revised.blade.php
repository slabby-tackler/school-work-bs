		Subject: Recent Shipment of Foxes (Order No. 2834256)
	</p>

	<p>
		On the 28th of February, I received a shipment of three foxes from you. I subsequently released them, so I could prepare for my hunt the following morning.
	</p>

	<p>
		Unfortunately, the foxes you sent acted in an unexpected way. When spotted by my hounds, they seemed rather confused on what they were supposed to be doing. When they did decide to
		run, it was sporadic as if they did not know where they wanted to go. Upon being caught, they seemed to lack the fighting spirit I have seen in others. The combination of these
		things led to an unexciting, disappointing hunt.
	</p>

	<p>
		Since these foxes performed poorly, I would like to receive replacements that will give better chase. As a hunting fox supplier, I would have expected something better. If your
		quality of foxes does not improve I will have to find another company to supply me.
	</p>

	<p>
		Sincerely,
	</p>
