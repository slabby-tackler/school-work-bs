		Dr. Marshall,
	</p>

	<p>
		I am a current student at UNC Charlotte. During this semester, I was required to take a technical writing course. In this course, we had to pick a different book from the Reaktion
		publisher, and do several writeups about it. The book I chose was “Fox.”
	</p>

	<p>
		While reading through this book, the author points out on multiple occasions that foxes have remained undomesticated throughout history. These comments raised a couple of questions
		for me. What keeps an animal from being domesticated? What is the process for animal domestication; is it a generational change, or is it per individual?
	</p>

	<p>
		After looking over your work on the domestication of donkeys, I think your input on this would be extremely valuable. I am interested to hear your thoughts on the matter.
	</p>

	<p>
		Thanks in advance,
	</p>

	<p>
