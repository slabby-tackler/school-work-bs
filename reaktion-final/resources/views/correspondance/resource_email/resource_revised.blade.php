		Dr. Marshall,
	</p>

	<p>
		I am a current student at UNC Charlotte. During this semester, I was required to take a technical writing course. In this course, we had to pick a different book from the Reaktion
		publisher, and do several writeups about it. The book I chose was “Fox.”
	</p>
	
	<p>
		While looking for information on animal domestication, I came across a few articles mentioning your name and research. Before trying to contact you, I looked over your work regarding
		the domestication of donkeys, to see if the answers I was looking for were already there. Your research was both interesting and informative, but I am still curious on a couple
		things that weren’t covered in too much depth.
	</p>

		While reading through my book, the author points out on multiple occasions that foxes have remained undomesticated throughout history. These comments raised a couple of questions
		for me. What keeps an animal from being domesticated? What is the process for animal domestication; is it a generational change, or is it per individual?

	<p>
		Thanks in advance,
	</p>
