		Dear Mr. Pennywhistle,
	</p>

	<p>
		Today Percival and I went out on a hunting expedition in the fields near both our properties. Our hunt was rather successful bringing in several foxes and hares. 
	</p>

	<p>
		It is with a heavy heart that I must inform you that during our hunt your pet fox, McCloud, was killed. My hounds unexpectedly gave chase, to which Percival and I followed to see
		what prey they had found. It was not until he lay lifeless on the ground that I noticed the collar around his neck. Had I seen it earlier, I would have called the hounds, or pulled
		them off myself.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		I understand how you felt about McCloud, I myself would be deeply saddened if one of my hounds suffered the same fate. I have wrapped the body and kept it so that you may collect it
		at your leisure.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		With regret,
	</p>

	<br>
	
	<p>
		Nicholas Wade
