		Dear Mr. Pennywhistle,
	</p>

	<p>
		Today Percival and I went out on a hunting expedition in the fields near both our properties. Our hunt would have been successful if not for the tragic end. 
	</p>

	<p>
		It is with a heavy heart that I must inform you that during our hunt your pet fox, McCloud, was killed. My hounds unexpectedly gave chase, to which Percival and I followed to see
		what prey they had found. It was not until we caught up that I noticed the collar around his neck. I immediately jumped from my horse, and tried to pull them off. Unfortunately, I
		was unsuccessful.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		I understand how you felt about McCloud, I myself would be deeply saddened if one of my hounds suffered the same fate. I have wrapped the body and kept it so that you may collect it
		when you are ready.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		With regret,
	</p>

	<br>
