		Dear Dr. Wallen,
	</p>

	<p>
		I am a current computer science student at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. I am a senior hoping to graduate this coming May. During this semester, I was required to
		enroll in an English technical writing course.
	</p>

	<p>
		In this English course, I have several writing assignments pertaining to a Reaktion book, and was directed to three different categories to choose from. While scrolling through
		all the possible books for this publisher, I came across yours: Fox. I chose this one because foxes are cunning and intelligent, and thought it would be an interesting read.
	</p>

	<p>
		While doing some preliminary research (when reading anything academic I like to learn about the author and get a brief overview of the subject) and after finishing the book, I
		thought of a few questions that I would like to ask about you and something in the book that particularly caught my attention:
		<ol>
			<li class="inquiry-number">
				After looking at your areas of interest and expertise, as well as your recently taught courses, a lot of the book seems beyond this scope. What was your interest in working
				with Reaktion to write this book?
			</li>
			<li class="inquiry-number">
				Reaktion has books published about a multitude of animals. What was the reasoning behind you choosing to write about foxes?
			</li>
			<li class="inquiry-number">
				In the linguistic section, you bring up how the term fox is used in “Pulp Fiction.”  You eventually point out that the title of the movie within (“Fox Force Five”) could be
				a homage to “Foxforce” the martial arts film. Is it possible that Quentin Tarantino was only cleverly linking two of his movies together while keeping the sexual
				connotations that you mention?
			</li>
		</ol>
	</p>

	<p>
		I am interested in hearing back from you in this matter, as I think it will add to my enjoyment of the book, and may help me with the project that I am working on. The best way to
		get back to me would be through my university email account: nwade3@uncc.edu.
	</p>

	<p>
		Sincerely,
	</p>
