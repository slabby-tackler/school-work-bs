		<strong>Summary</strong><br>
		After fox pelts and furs became a fashion commodity, there was a rise in fox hunting and trapping. In order to keep up with demand and counter the depletion of foxes, some were
		relocated	to the island Attu. This relocation put the foxes in a position of where they were in a “natural cage” as they had free roam of the island, but were unable to leave.
	</p>

	<p>
		This proposal is for a study into the possible ecological effects that relocating foxes to these islands potentially had.

		<strong>Introduction</strong><br>
		For several millennia, Man has hunted for food and skins as a means to survive. Eventually, for some cultures, hunting became a rite of passage. At the end of this rite, the animal
		was usually consumed in the normal fashion. Around the time of ancient civilizations, hunting became a sport for the wealthy and royal.
	</p>

	<p>
		Western civilizations around the sixteenth century considered foxes to be vermin, and actively hunted them. After some time, fox hunting became a sport within Europe. As foxes became
		sparse in England, they began to import them from other areas, primarily France.
	</p>

	<p>
		Starting with with the image of a famous actress at the time, fox pelts and furs became a fashion commodity. Because of this, there was an increase in the amount of fox hunting and
		trapping. The result of this increase caused a decrease in the total fox population. To counter this people began breeding foxes and relocating them to areas where they could be
		easily accessed, and reproduce in a constricted area without being in a cage.
	</p>

	<p>
		<strong>Significance</strong><br>
		Introducing a new species to an area can have a variety of diverse effects. An example of this is the fire ant. Fire ants are not native to North America; they were brought from
		across one of the oceans. Since being brought over the fire ant has been a pest that is both an annoyance and has killed livestock and crops.
	</p>

	<p>
		In the previous case, the fire ant was brought over by accident. There was no intent to bring them over, and it would have been difficult to prevent. If something that was brought
		introduced to an area by accident, what could the effects if a species was introduced with intent? With the boom in demand for fox pelts, to make foxes more easily accessible they
		were	shipped to the island Attu. They were left to breed and survive with the island they were put on as their “cage.” In doing this, the foxes could have had a negative effect on the
		ecological system of Attu.
	</p>

	<p>
		<strong>Plan of Work</strong><br>
		The scope of this study is to determine if the ecological system of the island of Attu could have properly sustained the importation of red and arctic foxes by trappers. To determine
		this a few items have to be determined: the breeding habits of foxes, available prey for the foxes, the available predators of the fox, the frequency the trappers took from the
		island, and the frequency new foxes were introduced.
	</p>

	<p>
		The predators of foxes and frequency of trappers is important to determine how much of a net increase or decrease of foxes. The available prey for the foxes would determine the
		survivability of the fox. An example of this would be that if the prey are being consumed faster than they are reproduced, that would in turn have a negative effect on the ecological
		system.

		<strong>Budget</strong><br>
		$100,000: Personnel - 1 researcher and 1 assistant<br>
		$50,000: Research materials<br>
		$40,000: Research & Lab space<br>
		$10,000: Travel
	</p>

	<p>
		<strong>Conclusion</strong><br>
		With the boom the fox pelt and 
		ur fashion, there was an increase in the hunting and trapping of foxes. To keep up with demand and to keep the supply from depleting, trappers relocated several arctic and red foxes
		to the island of Attu. This study is to look at the ecological effects that the introduction of foxes, whether positive or negative, to this island.
