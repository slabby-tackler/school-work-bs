*************
* Problem 1 *
*************
The problem I had when writing this program was the conditional control structure. It is different from how other languages deal with it, and took a few tries to find out how to utilize it to write a recursive function.

*************
* Problem 2 *
*************
Due to the work with problem 1, I did not have any problems on this one, which made it more simple.

*************
* Problem 3 *
*************
The only issue I had with this task was figuring out how to modify the existing code to combine one extra string.d
