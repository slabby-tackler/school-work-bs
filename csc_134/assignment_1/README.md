# Assignment 1

This assignment was the first programming assignment that I was given...ever. Most of this program is not my work as it was a fill in the blank assignment. The major difference between my revision and this original is that I added whitespace to make it look prettier.

These programs do basically what they say. lab-2\_circle-area\_*.cpp calculates the area of a circle. lab-2\_rectangle-area\_*.cpp calculates the area of a rectangle.
